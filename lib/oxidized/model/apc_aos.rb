    # # APC AOS Configuration
    #
    # Currently, the configuration of APC Network Management Cards can be downloaded with FTP only.
    #
    # A download of the configuration with SCP is [work in progress](https://github.com/ytti/oxidized/issues/1802).
    # As the APC has an unusual behavior (the connection is closed without an exit-status), this has to be
    # [fixed](https://github.com/net-ssh/net-scp/pull/71) upstream in [Net::SCP](https://github.com/net-ssh/net-scp).
    # As soon as there is a release of Net::SCP supporting the behavior of APC OS, we will activate SCP in oxidized.
    #
    # ## Can I collect more information than just the configuration?
    # APC OS does not have the ability to show the config.ini within an SSH-session. As oxidized can only get the
    # configuration with one input type at a time, it is not possible to fetch config.ini via FTP/SCP and get the output of
    # some commands via SSH at the same time.
    #
    # A ticket has been opened with APC support in order to support "cat config.ini" within an SSH-session, but
    # the chances it will be supported at some time are not very good, and older versions will still not support it.
    #
    # ## How do I activate FTP input?
    # In order to download the configuration with FTP (and in the future with SCP), you have to activate it as an
    # input in the oxidized configuration. If you do not activate the input, oxidized will fail for the node with
    # a rather unspecific error (`WARN -- : /apc status fail, retry attempt 1`).
    #
    # The configuration can be done either globally or only for the model apc_aos.
    #
    # The global configuration would look like this. Note that Oxidized will try every input type in the given order
    # until it succeeds, or it will report a failure.
    # ```yaml
    # input:
    #   default: ssh, ftp, scp
    # ```
    #
    # Configuration for activating the FTP input for apc_aos only:
    # ```yaml
    # input:
    #   default: ssh
    # models:
    #   apc_aos:
    #     input: ftp
    # ```
    #
    # You can also set specific username and password for apc_aos only:
    # ```yaml
    # username: default-user
    # password: default-password
    # input:
    #   default: ssh
    # models:
    #   apc_aos:
    #     username: apc-user
    #     password: apc-password
    #     input: ftp
    # ```
    # Represents the Apc_aos model.
    #
    # Handles configuration retrieval and processing for Apc_aos devices.
